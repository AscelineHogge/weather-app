# Weather-App 

## Project.
"You will use React to create a simple Pomodoro timer.
It will be static, without the need for a server."
This is a project carried out as part of the "Junior Web Developer" training in BeCode.

## Date of realization.
23 - 29 avril 2021.

## Objectifs.
- Display a big timer (minutes and seconds).
- Four buttons:
   - plus (+) and minus (-), they will allow the user to adjust the minutes counter - only when it's stopped.
   - start, to run the timer (it will then change to stop), to serve as a toggle button
   - reset, toâ€¦ reset the timer to its original value
- At the end of the timer, show a modal to invite user to take a break. The modal will have two buttons:
   - One to close the modal
   - Another to close the modal and start a new timer
